# sent_id = 5
# text = This BuzzMachine post argues that Google's rush toward ubiquity might backfire -- which we've all heard before, but it's particularly well-put in this post.

# sent_id = 6
# text = Google is a nice search engine.

# sent_id = 7
# text = Does anybody use it for anything else?

# sent_id = 8
# text = They own blogger, of course.

# sent_id = 9
# text = Is that a money maker?

# sent_id = 10
# text = I'm staying away from the stock.

# sent_id = 11
# text = I doubt the very few who actually read my blog haven't come across this yet, but I figured I'd put it out there anyways.

# sent_id = 12
# text = John Donovan from Argghhh! has put out an excellent sliding show on what was actually found and fought for in Fallujah.

# sent_id = 13
# text = Click here to view it.

# sent_id = 14
# text = He makes some good observations on a few of the pic'.

# sent_id = 15
# text = One of the pictures shows a flag that was found in Fallujah.

# sent_id = 16
# text = He took screenshots of two beheading video' on the next two pictures.

# sent_id = 17
# text = Compare the flags to the Fallujah one.

# sent_id = 18
# text = You have to see these slides.... they are amazing.

# sent_id = 19
# text = This Fallujah operation may turn out to be the most important operation done by the US military since the end of the war.

# sent_id = 20
# text = Let me join the chorus of annoyance over Google's new toolbar, which, as noted in the linked article, commits just about every sin a online marketer could commit, and besides makes up a few new ones.

# sent_id = 21
# text = I'm not fond of the Google-hates-privacy argument

# sent_id = 22
# text = (you don't need to use their site, you can opt-out of sharing your information, you don't need to send stuff to anyone with a Gmail account, and you... have far, far too much time on your hands -- if -- you're worried that wonder of wonders you might send something to someone who would forward an excerpt to someone who would then store it on a Gmail account.)

# sent_id = 23
# text = However, this toolbar is really bad news.

# sent_id = 24
# text = On the other hand, it looks pretty cool.

# sent_id = 25
# text = Iran says it is creating nuclear energy without wanting nuclear weapons.

# sent_id = 26
# text = The United States does not believe the iranian government.

# sent_id = 27
# text = One can suspect the iranian government.

# sent_id = 28
# text = But there's no proof.

# sent_id = 29
# text = I read an article in Time magazine accusing the iranian government of being willing to start a nuclear war and I sympathise with the article.

# sent_id = 30
# text = They are certainly being nasty to the United Nations Security Council in connection with the anti-proliferation treaty.

# sent_id = 31
# text = The President has also said he would like to see Israel wiped off the map which he could not even begin to try without nuclear weapons.

# sent_id = 32
# text = But he has insisted that he wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes.

# sent_id = 33
# text = Many people want to use diplomacy with Iran rather than military pressure.

# sent_id = 34
# text = But will diplomacy work?

# sent_id = 35
# text = And can anyone use military pressure without proof?

# sent_id = 36
# text = One reader pointed out that the President watched the Americans in the embassy when they took them hostage.

# sent_id = 37
# text = He has denied this.

# sent_id = 38
# text = We don't have to believe him.

# sent_id = 39
# text = But we can't prove it.

# sent_id = 40
# text = It does seem that Iranians frequently make statements and then hide behind lack of proof.

# sent_id = 41
# text = Angry crowds chanted anti-american slogans in the western city of Falluja (pop. 256,000) as the security police killed by US troops in a friendly fire incident were buried on Saturday.

# sent_id = 42
# text = Reuters reported that "sunni clerics in the town issued a 'declaration by the people of Fallujah' condemning the deaths of the security guards and police, announcing three days of mourning, and calling for a general strike today."

# sent_id = 43
# text = It read, "the people of Fallujah condemn the massacre which was committed against people dedicated to the protection of Fallujah on Friday.

# sent_id = 44
# text = Let aggressive (american) leaders and soldiers know that we are capable of protecting the city's security and safety, and ask them to lift their hands from the city. "

# sent_id = 45
# text = The clerics demanded talks with local US commanders.

# sent_id = 46
# text = Falluja has long been roiled by tense relations with the US soldiers there, since local Sunnis remain either committed to arab nationalism or have become sunni fundamentalists or even radicals.

# sent_id = 47
# text = Cities such as Falluja received special treatment from Saddam and enjoyed a disproportionate share of the country's wealth and power.

# sent_id = 48

# text = The Supreme Court divided along idelogical lines with John Roberts abstaining due to his involvement at the D.C. Circuit level and Anthony Kennedy joining the liberals today announced its ruling in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld in a 5-3 decision that is 185 pages long.

# sent_id = 51
# text = The actual vote is a little confusing.

# sent_id = 52
# text = Stay with me now: John Paul STEVENS delivered the opinion of the court in which KENNEDY, SOUTER, GINSBURG, and BREYER joined and with respect to parts i through iv, vi through vi-d-iii, vi-d-v, vi, and vii, joined with respect to v, SOUTER, GINSBURG, and BREYER iv and d-in-which parts an opinion.

# sent_id = 53
# text = Breyer filed a concurring opinion, in which KENNEDY, SOUTER, and GINSBURG joined.

# sent_id = 54

# sent_id = 57
# text = ALITO filed a dissenting opinion, in which SCALIA and THOMAS joined as to parts i through iii.

# sent_id = 58
# text = It will take me a little while to read the whole thing, but I rarely agree with a John Paul Stevens opinion.

# sent_id = 59
# text = I will post highlights from the opinion and dissents when I am finished.

# sent_id = 60
# text = Important news such as President Bush's miniscule calibrations on his marriage amendment / anti-gay (update: he's not against gays in the bedroom, just at the altar, where of course their relationships not only should be frowned upon but should be constitutionally excluded) has pushed Sudan not just off the front pages, or the a section, but completely out of the NY Times and Washington Post.

# sent_id = 61
# text = I had to go to the BBC for this report.

# sent_id = 62
# text = It is symptomatic of our fast-paced, 24 hour news-cycle lives, I suppose, that the biggest short-term humanitarian crisis in the world would be quickly eclipsed from the newspapers, once our Secretary of State was finished, with his whirlwind tour,.

# sent_id = 63
# text = It's just disappointing.

# sent_id = 64
# text = Most troubling, however, is the fact that the political will to end the crisis expressed a few short weeks ago seems to have ebbed.

# sent_id = 65
# text = At that time, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan demanded steps be taken to end the ethnic violence in Darfur within 48 hours.

# sent_id = 66
# text = Two weeks later, and the violence continues.

# sent_id = 67
# text = The African Union is clearly not up to the task of keeping the peace, pledging 300 troops to an area that will need 15,000, according to analysts.

# sent_id = 68
# text = And international donors have given only half of the relief aid that Darfur needs, according to the local UN officials.

# sent_id = 69
# text = So two weeks later we are, hear, after that dazzling PR display by Powell and Annan two weeks ago, and the situation on the ground in Darfur appears basically unchanged.

# sent_id = 70
# text = Warren Buffett is giving away 85% of his wealth, mostly to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

# sent_id = 71
# text = It's a move that really worries me; Buffett's usual justification for keeping most of his money was that he was still compounding the value of his fortune at a pretty high rate, so now any gifts would mean significantly less money for the foundation later.

# sent_id = 72
# text = It's a little hard to parse, but at this point his ostensible view is that the Gateses are very good money-redistributors, and he wants them to have the money as soon as possible.

# sent_id = 73
# text = Which essentially sounds like he's worried that Bill or Melinda are going to die soon.

# sent_id = 74
# text = I assume his actual reason is that he is worried that Berkshire Hathaway just can't grow enough quickly to justify his usual charity policy.

# sent_id = 75
# text = I'm not sure how the market will react.

# sent_id = 76
# text = It does not change the company's intrinsic worth, and as the article notes, the company might be added to a major index once the shares more get liquid.

# sent_id = 77
# text = On the other hand, this is essentially a statement that the company is overpriced from the guy who best knows it -- and happens to be the best investor of the last century.

# sent_id = 78
# text = ... em... the Gates foundation mainly invests in medical research and education, that means now donating adds a tremendous value compared to donating in ten years no.

# sent_id = 79
# text = Because the 10.000.000 people dying from malaria will otherwise be dead.

# sent_id = 80
# text = I.e.

# sent_id = 81
# text = He's not giving away 85%, each year he's giving a number of shares that decrease in number until gone (at the rate of 5% a year?).

# sent_id = 82
# text = He mentions his wife's death having an effect on him.

# sent_id = 83
# text = It sounds pretty rational that he is saying that Bill and Melinda are at a prime spot, so starting the money hose now is a good idea, but Buffet is still keeping most of his donation inside of Berkshire where it will compound.

# sent_id = 84
# text = Bill at the Fourth Rail over has an excellent essay on how the MSM and the UN, even the leftist countries in Europe, are basically accepting terrorist organizations as legitimate forms of a political party:

# sent_id = 85
# text = On the same day Palestinians protest in support of Hezbollah and Syria, the terrorist group Hamas has indicated it will participate in the upcoming scheduled parliamentary elections.

# sent_id = 86
# text = In Lebanon, there is serious debate within Hezbollah to the north about entering the lebanese political process in light of Syria's promised withdrawal.

# sent_id = 87
# text = Syria has agreed to withdraw under the conditions set forth in UNSC Resolution 1559, which has already begun.

# sent_id = 88
# text = UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has indicated it is time to "recognize Hezbollah" after being easily duped by the "message" on the placards they are using.

# sent_id = 89
# text = This acceptance of blatantly terrorist groups as legitimate freedom movements is a cancerous tumor on the United Nations and the media.

# sent_id = 90
# text = Still, despite their attempts to project strength in fighting terrorism, over three years after 9-11, the United Nations cannot properly define the word "terrorist", waffle over the issue of whether the murder of innocent civilians are terrorist acts.

# sent_id = 91
# text = The media routinely obscures the lines between terrorism and legitimate resistance, as the recent article by Daniel Okrent of the New York Times demonstrates.

# sent_id = 92
# text = ...

# sent_id = 93
# text = The decision to sidestep the obvious to satisfy the need to avoid confrontation does not bring peace, but only delays the eventual conflict as the predators of Hamas and Hezbollah exploit the inherent weakness of the internationals and the media.

# sent_id = 94
# text = I have now been fuming over this fact for a few weeks, since some organizations and governments ever suggested we need to accept the fact that Hezbollah will get involved in running Lebanon.

# sent_id = 95
# text = Is this wtf?

# sent_id = 96
# text = This is a plain and simple terrorist organization.

# sent_id = 97
# text = Is this the organization that bombed our Marine barracks in 1983, took Americans hostage throughout the 80's and should they now be considered a legitimate organization?

# sent_id = 98
# text = This is just another reason to never trust the MSM, and certainly not the Europeans.

# sent_id = 99
# text = The Iraqi Islamic Party led by Muhsin Abdul Hamid, has been among the few sunni muslim groups willing to cooperate with the Americans (even if rather lukewarmly).

# sent_id = 100
# text = It is now threatening to pull out of the Allawi caretaker government.

# sent_id = 101
# text = The IIP had also been the main force urging sunni Arabs to participate in the elections scheduled for January, and in this stance had been opposed by the Association of Muslim Scholars.

# sent_id = 102
# text = That the Iraqi Islamic Party is now contemplating leaving the Allawi government raises the question of whether a mass sunni Arab boycott of the elections is in the offing, thus fatally weakening the legitimacy of any new government.

# sent_id = 103
# text = Az-Zaman: the Association of Muslim Scholars forbid Iraqis to participate with the Americans in the attack on Fallujah.

# sent_id = 104
# text = In a communique, the AMS said that for Iraqis to take part with "raiding forces" in the assault on a city (such as Fallujah), the population of which is muslim would be considered the most mortal of mortal sins.

# sent_id = 105
# text = The sunni AMS told Iraqis, "you sinned when you participated with occupation forces in the assault on Najaf, and beware lest you repeat this same sin in Fallujah.

# sent_id = 106
# text = Remember that the occupation is emphemeral. "

# sent_id = 107
# text = The radical Sadr shiite movement issued a statement forbidding the participation of iraqi troops in the attack on Fallujah, as well.

# sent_id = 108
# text = The statement said, "at the men in the iraqi forces, whether national guards or others the majority of whom are muslim, we direct an appeal calling upon them to refrain, for committing this enormous sin under the banner of forces that do not respect our religion or any principles of basic humanity, and we ask them to view this war as illegal."

# sent_id = 109
# text = It called a "ploy" the assertaion that the attack was merely on foreign fighters at Fallujah.

# sent_id = 110
# text = The convergence of views among the more militant sunni muslim clerics of AMS and the radical Shiites of the Sadr movement has been seen before, during the initial US assault on Fallujah last spring and during the US attack on Mahdi Army militiamen in Najaf.

# sent_id = 111
# text = Most Shiites, however, are still reluctant to take major risks to support the Sunnis of Fallujah, many of whom had supported Saddam and his anti-shiite pogroms.

# sent_id = 112
# text = President Bush pinched a few nerves yesterday with his choice of words:

# sent_id = 113
# text = WASHINGTON-( Reuters)

# sent_id = 114
# text = U.S. muslim groups criticized President Bush on Thursday for calling a foiled plot to blow up airplanes, "part of a war with islamic fascists saying the term could inflame anti-muslim tensions."

# sent_id = 115
# text = U.S. officials have said the plot, thwarted by Britain, to blow up several aircraft over the Atlantic bore many of the hallmarks of al Qaeda.

# sent_id = 116
# text = "we believe this is an ill-advised term and we believe that it is counterproductive to associate Islam or Muslims with fascism," said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council advocacy group on American-Islamic Relations.

# sent_id = 117
# text = Which is why he didn't say we are at war with islamic people.

# sent_id = 118
# text = We are at war with islamic fascists.

# sent_id = 119
# text = Bush was purposely not associating Muslims with fascism by using the word "islamic" as an adjective, hence the qualifier.

# sent_id = 120
# text = And if you haven't heard by now, the roster of suspected terrorists has not a Tom, Dick or Harry among them:

# sent_id = 152
# text = Folks, if it's islamic, and fascist, it's an islamic fascist.

# sent_id = 153
# text = But we must pretend everyone is a possible suspect because we don't want to sound hateful and make airline travel more miserable than it has ever been.

# sent_id = 154
# text = On the internet site of Monotheism and Holy War (al-Tawhid wa al-Jihad), the group allegedly declared, "we announce that the Tawhid and Jihad group, its prince and soldiers, have pledged allegiance to the sheikh of the mujahideen Osama bin Laden."

# sent_id = 155
# text = This pledge is a new development.

# sent_id = 156
# text = Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and his group are said to have been bitter rivals of al-Qaeda during the afghan resistance days.

# sent_id = 157
# text = One witness at the Moutasaddiq trial in Germany alleged that Zarqawi had not allowed Monotheism and Holy War to share resources with al-Qaeda in the early zeros of the 21st century.

# sent_id = 158
# text = If the statement is true, it is a worrying sign that even the small radical divided guerrilla groups are being "picked up" by al-Qaeda.

# sent_id = 159
# text = This consolidation is obviously a result of Bush's aggressive invasion of Iraq and of the botching of the aftermath.

# sent_id = 160
# text = It is a setback for the war on terror.

# sent_id = 161
# text = Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan was a group of only a few hundred "afghan Arabs" who pledged personal loyalty to Usamah Bin Laden.

# sent_id = 162
# text = It could be notionally expanded to encompass the 5,000-strong "55th Brigade" of the Taliban regime, though this is not the technical definition.

# sent_id = 163
# text = Because Usamah is saudi, my guess is that they were especially influenced by an extremist form of the wahhabi school of Islam that predominates among some 15 million Saudia's citizens.

# sent_id = 164
# text = In 1998 they were joined by Egyptians from the al-Jihad al-Islami group of Ayman al-Zawahiri (many of these were from Upper Egypt, especially Asyut and environs).

# sent_id = 165
# text = After that point, al-Qaeda was a joint enterprise between the egyptian extremists and the polyglot Arabs around Bin Laden, only some of whom were saudi.

# sent_id = 166
# text = Zarqawi is a jordanian, and his Monotheism and Holy War group in Afghanistan probably had a distinctive coloration as mainly jordanian, palestinian and syrian.

# sent_id = 167
# text = They also had a special connection to some extremists in Jordan and Germany.

# sent_id = 168
# text = They are probably especially orient toward the salafi school of modern islamic thought, which has a Protestant-like emphasis on going back to the original practice of the early companions of the Prophet Muhammad.

# sent_id = 169
# text = (most Salafis are not militant or violent, though they tend to be rather narrow-minded on the order of Protestant pietists, in my experience).

# sent_id = 170
# text = Obviously Monotheism and Holy War does have a violent interpretation of Salafism, as the rather the leaders of the so-called German Peasant Rebellion among early Protestants did.

# sent_id = 171
# text = Another worrisome sign is that local sunni iraqi fundamentalists opposed to the US presence in Iraq have begun joining Monotheism and Holy War, and wearing its distinctive orange and black insignia.

# sent_id = 172
# text = These have been sighted among iraqi crowds and in Samarra on Haifa Street in Baghdad.

# sent_id = 173
# text = So there are now hundreds of al-Qaeda members in Iraq where there had been none before.

# sent_id = 174
# text = The consolidation with al-Qaeda of smaller radical local fundamentalist groups can also be seen in the case of the Fizazi group in tangiers that morphed into, the Moroccan Islamic Combatant group had members who met with September 11 ringleader Muhammad Atta, and were ultimately responsible in part for the Madrid train bombings.

# sent_id = 175
# text = The September 11's Panel will issue its findings on Thursday.

# sent_id = 176
# text = It notes 10 points at which the US made key mistakes that might have stopped Bin Laden's plot.

# sent_id = 177
# text = Four of these were under Clinton and 6 under Bush.

# sent_id = 178
# text = Bush came out today and said that if he had known what was coming, he would have expended every effort to stop it, and that Clinton would have so.

# sent_id = 179
# text = This statement, despite its facade of fair-mindedness, is so many weasel words.

# sent_id = 180
# text = Of course Bush would have tried to stop 9/11 if he had known it was coming.

# sent_id = 181
# text = The question is, "should he have known it was coming?"

# sent_id = 182
# text = , "the answer is yes!"

# sent_id = 183
# text = Now we know that Bush and his administration came into office obsessed with Iraq.

# sent_id = 184
# text = Cheney was looking at maps of Iraq oil fields and already muttering about opportunities there for US companies, in January or February of 2001.

# sent_id = 185
# text = Wolfowitz contradicted counter-terrorism czar Richard Clarke when the latter spoke of the al-Qaeda threat, insisting that the preeminent threat of terrorism against the US came from Iraq, and indicating he accepted Laurie Mylroie's crackpot conspiracy theory that Saddam was behind the 1993 World Trade Towers bombing.

# sent_id = 186
# text = If you believe crackpot theories instead of focusing on the reality -- that was an al-Qaeda operation -- mainly carried out by al-Gamaa al-Islamiyyah, an egyptian terrorist component allied with Bin Laden will then you concentrate on the wrong threat.

# sent_id = 187
# text = Even after the attacks on September 11, Bush was obsessing about Iraq.

# sent_id = 188
# text = Wolfowitz lied to him and said that there was a 10 to 50% chance that Iraq was behind them.

# sent_id = 189
# text = (on what evidence?

# sent_id = 190
# text = The hijackers were obviously al-Qaeda, and no operational links between al-Qaeda and Iraq had ever been found).

# sent_id = 191
# text = Rumsfeld initially rejected an attack on al-Qaeda bases in Afghanistan, saying there were "no good targets" in Afghanistan.

# sent_id = 192
# text = (what about 40 al-Qaeda bases that had trained the 9/11 hijackers and other terrorists gunning for the United States??)

# sent_id = 193
# text = The Pentagon did not even have a plan for dealing with Afghanistan or al-Qaeda that it could pull off the shelf, according to Bob Woodward.

# sent_id = 194
# text = Bush did not have his eye on the ball.

# sent_id = 195
# text = Neither Cheney, Rumsfeld, or Wolfowitz did.

# sent_id = 196
# text = They were playing Captain Ahab to Saddam's great white whale.

# sent_id = 197
# text = Imperial hubris makes the case that lots of people in the CIA and counter-terrorism divisions elsewhere in the US government knew all about Bin Laden and the threat he posed.

# sent_id = 198
# text = They were marginalized from all accounts and not listened to.

# sent_id = 199
# text = Bush demoted Dick Clarke, from his cabinet, among the most vocal and focused of the al-Qaeda experts.

# sent_id = 200
# text = Dick could never thereafter get any real cooperation from the cabinet officers, who outranked him, and he could not convince them to go to battle stations in the summer of 2001 when George Tenet's hair was "on fire" about the excited chatter the CIA was picking up from radical Islamist terrorists.

# sent_id = 201
# text = As for the Clinton administration, let me say one thing in its defense.

# sent_id = 202
# text = Clinton had worked out a deal with pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in summer of 1999 that would have allowed the US to send a special ops team in after Bin Laden in Qandahar, based from Pakistan.

# sent_id = 203
# text = I presume you need the Pakistan base for rescue operations in case anything went wrong.

# sent_id = 204
# text = You also need pakistani air space.

# sent_id = 205
# text = The plan was all set and could have succeeded.

# sent_id = 206
# text = But in fall of 1999, Gen. Pervez Musharraf made a coup against Nawaz Sharif.
