# text = Interim palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and the front-runner in the upcoming Jan. 9, 2005 presidential election talks Saturday Dec. 25, 2004, during his first official campaign speech in the West Bank town of Ramallah.

# sent_id = 997
# text = Cloaking himself in Yasser Arafat's legacy, Abbas pledged to fulfill palestinian dreams of statehood.

# sent_id = 998
# text = It seems that the (upcoming) palestinian leadership will not be a peace partner with Israel.

# sent_id = 999
# text = He is already demanding claims that Israel said no not only to, but the world to Arafat himself.

# sent_id = 1000
# text = Listing his priorities, Abbas told supporters of the ruling Fatah party that he was determined to provide security to his people and continue the struggle against Israel's partially completed West Bank barrier.

# sent_id = 1001
# text = Abbas also pledged to resolve the problem of millions of palestinian refugees and their descendants.

# sent_id = 1002
# text = Abbas, a refugee himself from what is the northern israeli city of Safed today, called the refugee issue "very important and very dangerous."

# sent_id = 1003
# text = Having visited the West Bank and Israel personally, I can say that this new political voice is threatening to collapse the peace process.

# sent_id = 1004
# text = If Abbas does not change his former thinking and continues the path of Yasser Arafat, then there will not be peace in the Holy Land and the Palestinians will ultimately suffer.

# text = The palestinian militant organisation Hamas has announced an end to rocket attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip after a weekend of escalating violence.

# sent_id = 1012
# text = Up to 40 rockets had been fired at Israel, weeks after its military withdrew from the territory.

# sent_id = 1013
# text = In response to the rockets, Israel resumed its policy of targeting militant leaders in air strikes.

# sent_id = 1014
# text = Authorised by Ariel Sharon to make "unrestricted" strikes, its military launched new missile attacks overnight.

# sent_id = 1015
# text = It looks as if Hamas has thrown the towel in for this round, unable to take the beating the Israeli Defense Forces have unleashed upon this terrorist group.

# sent_id = 1016
# text = Mahmoud Zahar, Hamas' leader declared the cease fire after Israel killed it's former leader, Muhammed Sheikh Khalil.

# sent_id = 1017
# text = Hamas has rather become unpopular in Gaza, as many see the israeli air strikes as a response towards the rocket attacks upon israeli soil.

# sent_id = 1018
# text = Egypt had a role to play as they convinced Hamas to end the attacks, although the same cannot be said of Islamic Jihad.

# sent_id = 1019
# text = (Jerusalem Post)

# sent_id = 1020
# text = "we are not happy with Hamas' position at this stage and in light of the israeli escalation against the Palestinians," commented Khader Habib, a senior Islamic Jihad official.

# sent_id = 1021
# text = "but it seems that Hamas has its own political agenda."

# sent_id = 1022
# text = [...]

# sent_id = 1023
# text = "the problem is not with the palestinian resistance groups but with Israel's scheme to destroy the Palestinians' infrastructure," Habib said.

# sent_id = 1024
# text = "Hamas remains targeted by Israel, as in the past, and the israeli occupation does not need excuses to pursue its aggression.

# sent_id = 1025
# text = Israel wants to drive the Palestinians toward civil war. "

# sent_id = 1026
# text = Islamic Jihad has refused to recognize the cease fire, and hopes to turn "the Gaza strip into a vast battlefield."

# sent_id = 1027
# text = Unless President Mahmoud Abbas steps in, Gaza will probably look like a battle field by the time Israel is done reminding Hamas of their critical error, although the only thing Abbas is doing is currently lashing out and refusing to take responsibility for his inability to act.
