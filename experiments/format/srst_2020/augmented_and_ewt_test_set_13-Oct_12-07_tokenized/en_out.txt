# text = important news such as President Bush 's miniscule calibrations on his marriage amendment / anti-gay ( update : he 's not against gays in the bedroom , just at the altar , where of course their relationships not only should be frowned upon but should be constitutionally excluded ) has pushed Sudan not just off the front pages , or the a section , but completely out of the NY Times and Washington Post .

# sent_id = 62
# text = it is symptomatic of our fast - paced , 24 hour news - cycle lives , I suppose , that the biggest short - term humanitarian crisis in the world would be quickly eclipsed from the newspapers , once our Secretary of State was finished , with his whirlwind tour , .

# sent_id = 63
# text = it 's just disappointing .

# sent_id = 64
# text = most troubling , however , is the fact that the political will to end the crisis expressed a few short weeks ago seems to have ebbed .

# sent_id = 65
# text = at that time , UN Secretary General Kofi Annan demanded steps be taken to end the ethnic violence in Darfur within 48 hours .

# sent_id = 66

# text = Warren Buffett is giving away 85 % of his wealth , mostly to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .

# sent_id = 71
# text = it 's a move that really worries me ; Buffett 's usual justification for keeping most of his money was that he was still compounding the value of his fortune at a pretty high rate , so now any gifts would mean significantly less money for the foundation later .

# sent_id = 72
# text = it 's a little hard to parse , but at this point his ostensible view is that the Gateses are very good money - redistributors , and he wants them to have the money as soon as possible .

# sent_id = 73
# text = which essentially sounds like he 's worried that Bill or Melinda are going to die soon .

# sent_id = 74
# text = I assume his actual reason is that he is worried that Berkshire Hathaway just ca n't grow enough quickly to justify his usual charity policy .

# sent_id = 75
# text = I 'm not sure how the market will react .

# sent_id = 76
# text = it does not change the company 's intrinsic worth , and as the article notes , the company might be added to a major index once the shares more get liquid .

# sent_id = 77
# text = on the other hand , this is essentially a statement that the company is overpriced from the guy who best knows it -- and happens to be the best investor of the last century .

# sent_id = 78
# text = ... em ... the Gates foundation mainly invests in medical research and education , that means now donating adds a tremendous value compared to donating in ten years no .

# sent_id = 79
# text = because the 10.000.000 people dying from malaria will otherwise be dead .

# sent_id = 80
# text = i.e .

# sent_id = 81
# text = he 's not giving away 85 % , each year he 's giving a number of shares that decrease in number until gone ( at the rate of 5 % a year ? ) .

# sent_id = 82
# text = he mentions his wife 's death having an effect on him .

# sent_id = 83
# text = it sounds pretty rational that he is saying that Bill and Melinda are at a prime spot , so starting the money hose now is a good idea , but Buffet is still keeping most of his donation inside of Berkshire where it will compound .

# sent_id = 84
# text = Bill at the Fourth Rail over has an excellent essay on how the MSM and the UN , even the leftist countries in Europe , are basically accepting terrorist organizations as legitimate forms of a political party :

# sent_id = 85
# text = on the same day Palestinians protest in support of Hezbollah and Syria , the terrorist group Hamas has indicated it will participate in the upcoming scheduled parliamentary elections .

# sent_id = 86
# text = in Lebanon , there is serious debate within Hezbollah to the north about entering the lebanese political process in light of Syria 's promised withdrawal .

# sent_id = 87
# text = Syria has agreed to withdraw under the conditions set forth in UNSC Resolution 1559 , which has already begun .

# sent_id = 88
# text = UN Secretary - General Kofi Annan has indicated it is time to " recognize Hezbollah " after being easily duped by the " message " on the placards they are using .

# sent_id = 89
# text = this acceptance of blatantly terrorist groups as legitimate freedom movements is a cancerous tumor on the United Nations and the media .

# sent_id = 90
# text = still , despite their attempts to project strength in fighting terrorism , over three years after 9-11 , the United Nations can not properly define the word " terrorist " , waffle over the issue of whether the murder of innocent civilians are terrorist acts .

# sent_id = 91
# text = the media routinely obscures the lines between terrorism and legitimate resistance , as the recent article by Daniel Okrent of the New York Times demonstrates .

# sent_id = 92
# text = ...

# sent_id = 93
# text = the decision to sidestep the obvious to satisfy the need to avoid confrontation does not bring peace , but only delays the eventual conflict as the predators of Hamas and Hezbollah exploit the inherent weakness of the internationals and the media .

# sent_id = 94
# text = I have now been fuming over this fact for a few weeks , since some organizations and governments ever suggested we need to accept the fact that Hezbollah will get involved in running Lebanon .

# sent_id = 95
# text = is this wtf ?

# sent_id = 96
# text = this is a plain and simple terrorist organization .

# sent_id = 97
# text = is this the organization that bombed our Marine barracks in 1983 , took Americans hostage throughout the 80's and should they now be considered a legitimate organization ?

# sent_id = 98
# text = this is just another reason to never trust the MSM , and certainly not the Europeans .

# sent_id = 99
# text = the Iraqi Islamic Party led by Muhsin Abdul Hamid , has been among the few sunni muslim groups willing to cooperate with the Americans ( even if rather lukewarmly ) .

# sent_id = 100
# text = it is now threatening to pull out of the Allawi caretaker government .

# sent_id = 101
# text = the IIP had also been the main force urging sunni Arabs to participate in the elections scheduled for January , and in this stance had been opposed by the Association of Muslim Scholars .

# sent_id = 102
# text = that the Iraqi Islamic Party is now contemplating leaving the Allawi government raises the question of whether a mass sunni Arab boycott of the elections is in the offing , thus fatally weakening the legitimacy of any new government .

# sent_id = 103
# text = Az - Zaman : the Association of Muslim Scholars forbid Iraqis to participate with the Americans in the attack on Fallujah .

# sent_id = 104
# text = in a communique , the AMS said that for Iraqis to take part with " raiding forces " in the assault on a city ( such as Fallujah ) , the population of which is muslim would be considered the most mortal of mortal sins .

# sent_id = 105
# text = the sunni AMS told Iraqis , " you sinned when you participated with occupation forces in the assault on Najaf , and beware lest you repeat this same sin in Fallujah .

# sent_id = 106
# text = remember that the occupation is emphemeral . "

# sent_id = 107
# text = the radical Sadr shiite movement issued a statement forbidding the participation of iraqi troops in the attack on Fallujah , as well .

# sent_id = 108
# text = the statement said , " at the men in the iraqi forces , whether national guards or others the majority of whom are muslim , we direct an appeal calling upon them to refrain , for committing this enormous sin under the banner of forces that do not respect our religion or any principles of basic humanity , and we ask them to view this war as illegal . "

# sent_id = 109
# text = it called a " ploy " the assertaion that the attack was merely on foreign fighters at Fallujah .

# sent_id = 110
# text = the convergence of views among the more militant sunni muslim clerics of AMS and the radical Shiites of the Sadr movement has been seen before , during the initial US assault on Fallujah last spring and during the US attack on Mahdi Army militiamen in Najaf .

# sent_id = 111
# text = most Shiites , however , are still reluctant to take major risks to support the Sunnis of Fallujah , many of whom had supported Saddam and his anti-shiite pogroms .

# sent_id = 112
# text = President Bush pinched a few nerves yesterday with his choice of words :

# sent_id = 113
# text = WASHINGTON - ( Reuters )

# sent_id = 114
# text = U.S. muslim groups criticized President Bush on Thursday for calling a foiled plot to blow up airplanes , " part of a war with islamic fascists saying the term could inflame anti-muslim tensions . "

# sent_id = 115
# text = U.S. officials have said the plot , thwarted by Britain , to blow up several aircraft over the Atlantic bore many of the hallmarks of al Qaeda .

# sent_id = 116
# text = " we believe this is an ill - advised term and we believe that it is counterproductive to associate Islam or Muslims with fascism , " said Nihad Awad , executive director of the Council advocacy group on American - Islamic Relations .

# sent_id = 117
# text = which is why he did n't say we are at war with islamic people .

# sent_id = 118
# text = we are at war with islamic fascists .

# sent_id = 119
# text = Bush was purposely not associating Muslims with fascism by using the word " islamic " as an adjective , hence the qualifier .

# sent_id = 153
# text = but we must pretend everyone is a possible suspect because we do n't want to sound hateful and make airline travel more miserable than it has ever been .

# sent_id = 154
# text = on the internet site of Monotheism and Holy War ( al - Tawhid wa al - Jihad ) , the group allegedly declared , " we announce that the Tawhid and Jihad group , its prince and soldiers , have pledged allegiance to the sheikh of the mujahideen Osama bin Laden . "

# sent_id = 155
# text = this pledge is a new development .

# sent_id = 156
# text = Abu Musab al - Zarqawi and his group are said to have been bitter rivals of al - Qaeda during the afghan resistance days .

# sent_id = 157
# text = one witness at the Moutasaddiq trial in Germany alleged that Zarqawi had not allowed Monotheism and Holy War to share resources with al - Qaeda in the early zeros of the 21st century .

# sent_id = 158
# text = if the statement is true , it is a worrying sign that even the small radical divided guerrilla groups are being " picked up " by al - Qaeda .

# sent_id = 159
# text = this consolidation is obviously a result of Bush 's aggressive invasion of Iraq and of the botching of the aftermath .

# sent_id = 160
# text = it is a setback for the war on terror .

# sent_id = 161
# text = Al - Qaeda in Afghanistan was a group of only a few hundred " afghan Arabs " who pledged personal loyalty to Usamah Bin Laden .

# sent_id = 162
# text = it could be notionally expanded to encompass the 5,000 - strong " 55th Brigade " of the Taliban regime , though this is not the technical definition .

# sent_id = 163
# text = because Usamah is saudi , my guess is that they were especially influenced by an extremist form of the wahhabi school of Islam that predominates among some 15 million Saudia 's citizens .

# sent_id = 164
# text = in 1998 they were joined by Egyptians from the al - Jihad al - Islami group of Ayman al - Zawahiri ( many of these were from Upper Egypt , especially Asyut and environs ) .

# sent_id = 165
# text = after that point , al - Qaeda was a joint enterprise between the egyptian extremists and the polyglot Arabs around Bin Laden , only some of whom were saudi .

# sent_id = 166
# text = Zarqawi is a jordanian , and his Monotheism and Holy War group in Afghanistan probably had a distinctive coloration as mainly jordanian , palestinian and syrian .

# sent_id = 167
# text = they also had a special connection to some extremists in Jordan and Germany .

# sent_id = 168
# text = they are probably especially orient toward the salafi school of modern islamic thought , which has a Protestant - like emphasis on going back to the original practice of the early companions of the Prophet Muhammad .

# sent_id = 169
# text = ( most Salafis are not militant or violent , though they tend to be rather narrow - minded on the order of Protestant pietists , in my experience ) .

# sent_id = 170
# text = obviously Monotheism and Holy War does have a violent interpretation of Salafism , as the rather the leaders of the so - called German Peasant Rebellion among early Protestants did .

# sent_id = 171
# text = another worrisome sign is that local sunni iraqi fundamentalists opposed to the US presence in Iraq have begun joining Monotheism and Holy War , and wearing its distinctive orange and black insignia .

# sent_id = 172
# text = these have been sighted among iraqi crowds and in Samarra on Haifa Street in Baghdad .

# sent_id = 173
# text = so there are now hundreds of al - Qaeda members in Iraq where there had been none before .

# sent_id = 174
# text = the consolidation with al - Qaeda of smaller radical local fundamentalist groups can also be seen in the case of the Fizazi group in tangiers that morphed into , the Moroccan Islamic Combatant group had members who met with September 11 ringleader Muhammad Atta , and were ultimately responsible in part for the Madrid train bombings .

# sent_id = 175
# text = the September 11's Panel will issue its findings on Thursday .

# sent_id = 176
# text = it notes 10 points at which the US made key mistakes that might have stopped Bin Laden 's plot .

# sent_id = 177
# text = four of these were under Clinton and 6 under Bush .

# sent_id = 178
# text = Bush came out today and said that if he had known what was coming , he would have expended every effort to stop it , and that Clinton would have so .

# sent_id = 179
# text = this statement , despite its facade of fair - mindedness , is so many weasel words .

# sent_id = 180
# text = of course Bush would have tried to stop 9/11 if he had known it was coming .

# sent_id = 181
# text = the question is , " should he have known it was coming ? "

# sent_id = 182
# text = , " the answer is yes ! "

# sent_id = 183
# text = now we know that Bush and his administration came into office obsessed with Iraq .

# sent_id = 184
# text = Cheney was looking at maps of Iraq oil fields and already muttering about opportunities there for US companies , in January or February of 2001 .

# sent_id = 185
# text = Wolfowitz contradicted counter-terrorism czar Richard Clarke when the latter spoke of the al - Qaeda threat , insisting that the preeminent threat of terrorism against the US came from Iraq , and indicating he accepted Laurie Mylroie 's crackpot conspiracy theory that Saddam was behind the 1993 World Trade Towers bombing .

# sent_id = 186
# text = if you believe crackpot theories instead of focusing on the reality -- that was an al - Qaeda operation -- mainly carried out by al - Gamaa al - Islamiyyah , an egyptian terrorist component allied with Bin Laden will then you concentrate on the wrong threat .

# sent_id = 187
# text = even after the attacks on September 11 , Bush was obsessing about Iraq .

# sent_id = 188
# text = Wolfowitz lied to him and said that there was a 10 to 50 % chance that Iraq was behind them .

# sent_id = 189
# text = ( on what evidence ?

# sent_id = 190
# text = the hijackers were obviously al - Qaeda , and no operational links between al - Qaeda and Iraq had ever been found ) .

# sent_id = 191
# text = Rumsfeld initially rejected an attack on al - Qaeda bases in Afghanistan , saying there were " no good targets " in Afghanistan .

# sent_id = 192
# text = ( what about 40 al - Qaeda bases that had trained the 9/11 hijackers and other terrorists gunning for the United States ?? )

# sent_id = 193
# text = the Pentagon did not even have a plan for dealing with Afghanistan or al - Qaeda that it could pull off the shelf , according to Bob Woodward .

# sent_id = 194
# text = Bush did not have his eye on the ball .

# sent_id = 195
# text = neither Cheney , Rumsfeld , or Wolfowitz did .

# sent_id = 196
# text = they were playing Captain Ahab to Saddam 's great white whale .

# sent_id = 197
# text = imperial hubris makes the case that lots of people in the CIA and counter-terrorism divisions elsewhere in the US government knew all about Bin Laden and the threat he posed .

# sent_id = 198
# text = they were marginalized from all accounts and not listened to .

# sent_id = 199
# text = Bush demoted Dick Clarke , from his cabinet , among the most vocal and focused of the al - Qaeda experts .

# sent_id = 200
# text = Dick could never thereafter get any real cooperation from the cabinet officers , who outranked him , and he could not convince them to go to battle stations in the summer of 2001 when George Tenet 's hair was " on fire " about the excited chatter the CIA was picking up from radical Islamist terrorists .

# sent_id = 201
# text = as for the Clinton administration , let me say one thing in its defense .

# sent_id = 202
# text = Clinton had worked out a deal with pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in summer of 1999 that would have allowed the US to send a special ops team in after Bin Laden in Qandahar , based from Pakistan .

# sent_id = 203
# text = I presume you need the Pakistan base for rescue operations in case anything went wrong .

# sent_id = 204
# text = you also need pakistani air space .

# sent_id = 205
# text = the plan was all set and could have succeeded .
